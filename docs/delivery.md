## Components

### Requirements

#### Accessibility

Components delivered through the Carbon Design System should be AA compliant. Our current focus is on addressing WCAG 2.0 bug fixes that are present in React, and then afterwards Vanilla.

In general, here is our checklist for addressing accessibility-related violations:

- A component should be AA compliant
- If not, then our focus should be on fixing WCAG 2.0 issues
- We can accept WCAG 2.1 enhancements depending on scope and ability of IBMa to review
- If there is a WCAG 2.1 requirement that would supercede a WCAG 2.0 bug fix, then we should implement the 2.1 behavior
